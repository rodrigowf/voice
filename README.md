   ```

3. Run the installation script:
   ```bash
   sudo ./install.sh
   ```

The installation script will:
- Install required system dependencies
- Set up a Python virtual environment
- Install Python package dependencies
- Configure audio settings
- Create a desktop entry for easy access

## Usage

1. Start the application:
   ```bash
   ./run.sh
   ```
   Or launch it from your applications menu.

2. Look for the green icon in your system tray.

3. To transcribe:
   - Hold F4
   - Speak clearly
   - Release F4
   - The transcribed text will appear at your cursor position

4. Additional features:
   - Right-click the tray icon for options
   - Switch between languages from the tray menu
   - Click "About" for version information
   - Use "Exit" to close the application

## Configuration

The application can be configured by modifying `src/voice_to_text/config.py`:

- Audio settings (sample rate, channels, chunk size)
- Recording thresholds and durations
- Language preferences
- UI customization

## Architecture

The application is structured into several key components:

```
src/voice_to_text/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ audio/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ recorder.py    # Audio capture and processing
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ transcriber.py # Whisper API integration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ui/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tray_icon.py   # System tray interface
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ text_output.py # Text insertion handling
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ keyboard_handler.py # Hotkey management
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ config.py          # Application configuration
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **No audio input detected**
   - Check your microphone permissions
   - Verify ALSA/PulseAudio configuration
   - Run `alsamixer` to check input levels

2. **Transcription not appearing**
   - Ensure your OpenAI API key is valid
   - Check internet connectivity
   - Verify cursor is in a text-editable area

3. **System tray icon not showing**
   - Ensure GTK3 is properly installed
   - Check if your desktop environment supports system trays

### Logs

Application logs are stored in `voice_to_text.log`. Enable debug logging by modifying the logging level in `run.py`.
